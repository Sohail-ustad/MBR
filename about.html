            Blood donation is a vital part of worldwide healthcare. It relates to blood transfusion as a life-sustaining and life-saving procedure as well as a form of therapeutic phlebotomy as a primary medical intervention. Over one hundred million units of blood are donated each year throughout the world.[1] This article will concisely discuss a short history of blood donation origin and purpose, blood testing, donor eligibility and selection, adverse effects of donation, blood donation as a primary medical intervention, and a brief discussion of pathogen reduction and inactivation for donated blood.

            Blood donation for transfusion is a vital step in the management of many clinical problems, with the two primary indications being anemia and acute blood loss. Blood donation itself is also used to primarily treat a small subset of medical conditions. At the beginning of the 20th century, Karl Landsteiner identified ABO blood groups, at which time blood typing of individuals was only beginning to be adopted as a universally standard practice.[2] Due to the inability to prevent blood from clotting once removed from the donor and thus store and transfer blood to be delivered when needed later, transfusions were only carried out on a limited basis. Blood was transfused directly from donor to recipient without intervening storage or transport. This method worked for small numbers of patients and only on a small scale, as donors and recipients needed to be connected both in time and space. There was a time when lists of donors were maintained of persons locally available to be called in to donate to patients at any time as needed. Necessity drove the development of more flexible donation and storage practices when World War I began. "On-demand" blood donation was not feasible for such a large scale effort. Soldiers were dying of otherwise non-fatal wounds due mainly to the inability to perform a timely blood transfusion.

            Concerted efforts to develop a means of storing and transferring blood to meet the war-time demands led to several discoveries. One, clotting was inhibited by adding citrate to the donated blood.[3] Second, glucose was added to the solution to allow the red blood cells to remain viable for several weeks when stored in refrigerated conditions.[4],[5] The first time blood was "banked" as is common practice currently, was when Captain Oswald Hope Robertson of the US Army Medical Corps collected Group O blood, combined it with glucose, and stored it before the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917. This was a pivotal shift from the prior practices of "direct" blood donation to "indirect" blood donation, importantly separating donors from their recipients geographically and temporally. This development made blood donation and transfusion a much more practical and useful medical intervention.[6]
